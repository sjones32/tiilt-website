                <p class="window__description">Excitement for the Maker Movement continues to grow. Part of this growth stems
                    from the idea that Making provides a
                    means for democratization of fabrication and invention. While this is true, in part, the practices and
                    people that are
                    typically included under this brand are limited. In particular, issues of diversity, equity and inclusivity
                    are seldom
                    at the forefront of the design and implementation of Makerspaces, the tools used or the artifacts created.
                    Hence, the
                    purpose of this course is to bring issues of diversity, equity and inclusivity to the forefront. In
                    particular, the
                    course will push students to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>critically explore Making as a practice that promotes democratization.</li>
                        <li>develop interfaces that allow a broader population of students to participate in digital
                            fabrication.</li>
                        <li>co-design artifacts that positively impact accessibility and inclusivity.</li>
                    </ol> The course will include guest speakers, laboratory portions and a
                    final project that encourages students to develop publishable scholarship and/or functional prototypes, as
                    they work in

                    technologies for supporting
                    learning. Students will be expected to do computer programming as part of this class. During this
                    course,
                    students will get a hands-on introduction to designing novel interfaces with multimodal sensor
                    technology.
                    Each week students will explore a specific modality or theory, and complete one or more activities
                    that
                    will
                    challenge them to utilize that theory or modality. In order to support a strong introduction to
                    both
                    theory
                    and practice, every week will include one class session involving hands-on work, and another that
                    uses
                    a
                    seminar style to discuss theory and closely examine the assigned Readings. Students will be
                    expected to
                    use
                    insights and ideas presented in the class in a collaborative final project.</p>
